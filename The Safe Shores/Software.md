# Warez and Software Sites!

Here is a full curated list full of software & warez Torrent and Direct Download sites! All sites listed below have good quality to them and are trusted. 
The list will be constantly updated and checked on, so please take a look back here every now and then!

**Trusted Sites and Quality stuff:**
**- FileCR.com** (Sugar daddy for every software, including small ones, so far no uploads have been caught as unsafe)
**- RSLoad.net** (Russian software cracking section and forum for repacks, etc. one of my top choices)
**- RuTracker.org** (Top choices for torrenting Software, its safe, high-quality, and I recommend it a LOT)
**- RuTor.info/.is** (Many Portable Software and Repack Torrents, one of my go-to places and many trusted uploaders are there, including m0nkrus and KpoJIuK)
**- VSTorrent.org** (First place you should check for Audio software like FL Studio, Ableton, and Deflemask)
**- Audioz.Download** (Second place you should check for Audio Software)
**- Repack.me** (One of my favorite software download sites, many trusted repackers from RSLoad, RuTor, etc.)
**- LRepacks.ru** (Its like Repack.me but with different software assortments sometimes)
**- m0nkrus** (Highly trusted software repacker, he mostly does Adobe, and big time software, uploads on torrent sites)
**- RadiXX11** (Software cracker and keygen maker, he has two blogger sites. One is dead, and the second one which is alive, https://radixx11rce2.blogspot.com/)
**- AppNee** (So far, Trusted Re-Uploads and Uploads of safe cracks, repacks, serialz, and other software related things. I recommend using appnee.com because their other site is going down soon)
**- MrSzzS** (Trusted Software cracker and uploader, he only has a YouTube Channel. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcf3dtQFVb5zfy0jGYNpA0w)
**- DownloadHa.com** (Persian site with a LOT of general downloads, its trusted, safe, and has multiple different re-uploads. Some untrusted software crackers there, but its most likely safe and untouched. I highly recommend using MATE Translate on this site. Only go for trusted names of download links.)
**- Downloadly.ir** (Very similar to DownloadHa and is trusted. I recommend using translate and VPN here)
**- YasDL.com** (Another persian site for general downloading, same thing applies to the other two above, use VPN for all three if you can't get on these sites)
**- PiratePC.me** (While being flagged as malicious by Google Safe browsing and Antiviruses, PiratePC is a good place for cracked software, and the owners seem pretty chill to me)
**- Mobilism** (The best place for Android APKs, and modded stuff!)
**- Soft98.ir** (A good place for software, its like DownloadHa and YasDL, but for Software stuff only iirc, use a VPN, and translator when entering the site)
**- DLFox.com** (One of the best places for general downloading, its as juicy as YasDL)
**- WorldSrc.net** (English general downloading site, its good as well)
**- Sanet.st SoftwareArchive** (General download site, its basically Archive.org but they don't care about Piracy)
**- NsaneForums.com** (Software Download Forum)

## THIS IS JUST WHAT I HAVE FOR NOW. I WILL CLEAN THIS LIST UP SOON!!!
